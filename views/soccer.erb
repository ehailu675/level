  <ul class=bullets>
   <li> It's no secret that the this team is made up of brilliant performances as they have racked up 4 Olympic gold medals and 3 World cup wins
   <li> They are now bringing to light the gender pay gap prevalent in the world of pro soccer by taking legal action against pay discrimination.
   <li> For example, for their 2015 win in the World Cup the team was given $2 million. The USA men's team was given $9 million for LOSING in round sixteen. Even more alarming, the Germany men's team recieved $35 million for winning that World Cup. 
  <li>When looking at the women's income individually, they would each earch $99,000 if they won 20 games while the men would most likely earn somewhere around $265,00 for winning the same number of games. On top of that, the women are not paid after the 20 games while the men can get paid as much as $17,625 for each game past 20. 
  <li> Female soccer players are also forced to compete on potentially dangerous artifical turf (as shown in the photo below) at the World Cup which is something men have never had to do at their own World Cup. </li>
